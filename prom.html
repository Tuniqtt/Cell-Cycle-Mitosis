                Prometaphase is a critical stage in the process of mitosis, seamlessly following prophase and serving as
                a bridge to metaphase. During this dynamic phase, significant events unfold to prepare the cell for the
                precise separation of its genetic material. One prominent feature of prometaphase is the continuation of
                chromatin condensation initiated in prophase. The diffuse chromatin further transforms into
                well-defined, condensed structures known as chromosomes. Each chromosome consists of two identical
                sister chromatids connected by a centromere, presenting a visually distinct and organized arrangement
                that facilitates their subsequent movement and segregation.
                <br><br>A key event distinguishing prometaphase is the breakdown of the nuclear envelope that previously
                enclosed the cell's nucleus. As the nuclear envelope dissolves, microtubules emanating from centrosomes
                at opposite poles of the cell infiltrate the nuclear region, establishing a dynamic network called the
                mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle plays a crucial role in orchestrating the movement of chromosomes
                during mitosis. Microtubules extend from the centrosomes, interact with chromosomes, and facilitate
                their alignment at the cell's equatorial plane. This alignment is pivotal for ensuring the accurate and
                equal distribution of genetic material between the two emerging daughter cells.<br><br>
                The cell carefully regulates the progression through prometaphase by activating the mitotic checkpoint.
                This surveillance mechanism scrutinizes factors such as the attachment of microtubules to chromosomes
                and the proper alignment of chromosomes at the cell's equator. Only when these criteria are met does the
                cell receive the signal to proceed to the next stages of mitosis. In summary, prometaphase is
                characterized by chromatin condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and the formation of the mitotic
                spindle, collectively contributing to the seamless orchestration of chromosome segregation in mitosis.
